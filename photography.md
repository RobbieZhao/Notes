## Exposure

what is exposure: basically how bright your photo is

- underexposed: a photo that is too dark
- overexposed: a photo that is too bright
- properly exposed: a photo that is not too bright and not too dark

exposure can be adjusted through: aperture, shutter speed, iso

exposure is a balance of lights and camera settings

## Aperature (iris)

 - The hole inside the camera lens that lets in light
 - The f-stop or f-number is a scale that represents the size of the aperature
   - Smaller f-number, the bigger the aperature
 - Depth of field: how much is in focus in your photo
   - A wide open aperature has a shallower depth of field than a smaller aperature

## Shutter speed

 - A fraction of a second your camera is capturing the light. A shutter is like a curtain that blocks the light into your camera
 - for beginners, try shooting at least at 1/80 or 1/100 to reduce camera shake

## ISO

 - ISO: The sensitivity of your camera's sensor to light. It's a digital way to increase or decrease the exposure
   - Increase the ISO increases the exposure. 
   - Scale: 100, 200, 400, 800, ...
 - On most entry-level camera,s we recommend staying below ISO 1600.
 - Base ISO: lowest ISO setting on a camera that does not digitally increase exposure. Most will be 100.

## Expose meter

## Metering mode

 - spot weighted: small objects with contrasting background
 - center weighted: when you know the subject will be in the center
 - matrix/evaluative: diverse lighting situations


Photo tip:

 - I started with my base ISO of 100, then adjusted f-stop, then shutter

## modes

- (Intelligent Auto):
Allows you to shoot still images with the settings adjusted automatically.

- (Superior Auto):
Allows you to shoot still images in higher quality than with Intelligent Auto mode.

- P (Program Auto):
Allows you to shoot with the exposure adjusted automatically (both the shutter speed and the aperture value (F value)). Also you can select various settings from the menu.

- A (Aperture Priority):
Allows you to adjust the aperture and shoot, for example when you want to blur the background, etc.

- S (Shutter Priority):
Allows you to shoot fast-moving subjects etc., by manually adjusting the shutter speed.

- M (Manual Exposure):
Allows you to shoot still images with the desired exposure by adjusting the shutter speed and the aperture value.

- (Movie):
Allows you to change the settings for movie recording.

- (Sweep Panorama):
Allows you to shoot a panoramic image by compositing the images.

- SCN (Scene Selection):
Allows you to shoot with preset settings according to the subject and scene.


## Exposure compensation

aperature priority: exposure compensation changes the shutter speed
shutter priority: exposure compensation changes the aperature
program priority: exposure compensation changes the shutter speed

manual mode: does not make sense to use exposure compensation because you can change the settings to adjust the exposure
