Insertion sort: behaves well when the array is almost sorted, or when the array is small


### Quick sort (aka Partition sort)

 - best case: `theta(NlogN)`
 - worst case: `theta(N^2)`
 - on average: `theta(NlogN)`
 - Quick sort is just BST sort (same amount of comparisons)
 - how to avoid the worst case?
   - Always use the median
