# Book I. 

Of the causes of improvement in the productive powers of labour, and of the order according to which its produce is naturally distributed among the different ranks of the people.

## Chapter I Of the division of labour

Division of labor leads to increase in productivity in three ways:
 
 - Division of labor increases dexterity in every particular workman.
 - Division of labor saves time commonly lost in passing from one work to the other.
 - Division of labor leads to the invention of a great number of machines, which facilitate labour.

## Chapter II Of the principle which gives occasion to the division of labour

The division of labour is the slow and gradual consequence of human's natural propensity to truck, barter, and exchange.

## Chapter III That the division of labour is limited by  the extent of the market

As it is the power of exchanging that gives occasion to the division of labour, so the extent of this division must always be limited by the extent of that power, or, in other words, by the extent of the market.

Water-carriage expands existing markets, and makes impossible trade possible.

## Chapter IV Of the origin and use of money

Besides one's own produce, people need something that few people would refuse to have.

In all countries, men seem to have preference for metals:

 - Metals can be kept with little loss
 - Metals can be divided without any loss
 - Metals can be reunited by fusion without any loss

The use of metals have inconvenience with weighing and assaying, thus leads to coined money (metals with stamps).  (assay: to test something (such as a metal or drug) to find out what it contains)

 - At first, stamps are only one one side of metals, which only ascertain the goodness of the metal.
 - Stamps on both sides and sometimes the edges of the metal ascertain the goodness and weight of the metal

The denomination of the coins originally reflects the weight of the metal. But the avarice of the princess and sovereign states have diminished the real weight of metal, which led to the depreciation of coins.

Value include: 

 - Value in use
 - Value in exchange (relative value)
 - These two are frequently negatively correlated.
