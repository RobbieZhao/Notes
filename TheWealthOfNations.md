# Book I. 

Of the causes of improvement in the productive powers of labour, and of the order according to which its produce is naturally distributed among the different ranks of the people.

## Chapter I Of the division of labour

Division of labor leads to increase in productivity in three ways:
 
 - Division of labor increases dexterity in every particular workman.
 - Division of labor saves time commonly lost in passing from one work to the other.
 - Division of labor leads to the invention of a great number of machines, which facilitate labour.

## Chapter II Of the principle which gives occasion to the division of labour

The division of labour is the slow and gradual consequence of human's natural propensity to truck, barter, and exchange.

## Chapter III That the division of labour is limited by  the extent of the market

As it is the power of exchanging that gives occasion to the division of labour, so the extent of this division must always be limited by the extent of that power, or, in other words, by the extent of the market.
