# Book I. 

Of the causes of improvement in the productive powers of labour, and of the order according to which its produce is naturally distributed among the different ranks of the people.

## Chapter I Of the division of labour

Division of labor leads to increase in productivity in three ways:
 
 - Division of labor increases dexterity in every particular workman.
 - Division of labor saves time commonly lost in passing from one work to the other.
 - Division of labor leads to the invention of a great number of machines, which facilitate labour.

## Chapter II Of the principle which gives occasion to the division of labour

The division of labour is the slow and gradual consequence of human's natural propensity to truck, barter, and exchange.

## Chapter III That the division of labour is limited by  the extent of the market

As it is the power of exchanging that gives occasion to the division of labour, so the extent of this division must always be limited by the extent of that power, or, in other words, by the extent of the market.

Water-carriage expands existing markets, and makes impossible trade possible.

## Chapter IV Of the origin and use of money

Besides one's own produce, people need something that few people would refuse to have.

In all countries, men seem to have preference for metals:

 - Metals can be kept with little loss
 - Metals can be divided without any loss
 - Metals can be reunited by fusion without any loss

The use of metals have inconvenience with weighing and assaying, thus leads to coined money (metals with stamps).  (assay: to test something (such as a metal or drug) to find out what it contains)

 - At first, stamps are only one one side of metals, which only ascertain the goodness of the metal.
 - Stamps on both sides and sometimes the edges of the metal ascertain the goodness and weight of the metal

The denomination of the coins originally reflects the weight of the metal. But the avarice of the princess and sovereign states have diminished the real weight of metal, which led to the depreciation of coins.

Value include: 

 - Value in use
 - Value in exchange (relative value)
 - These two are frequently negatively correlated.

## Chapter V Of the real and nominal price of commodities, or of their price in labour, and their price in money

How is exchangeable value measured?

 - Exchangeable value is best measured by labor, which doesn't vary in value.
 - But it's often difficult to ascertain the proportion of labor needed between commodities. So through haggling and bargaining, the quantities of other commodities become a better measure.
 - When barter ceases, money becomes the measure.

The labor needed to produce a product is the real price, money is the nominal price.

Difference between real price and exchangeable value?

 - Real price: how many units of labor
 - Exchangeable value: more like a relative price (proportion of labor between two products)
 - Indeed, both are measured by labor.

At the same time and place, money measures exchangeable value.

Money price is decided not by the denomination of coins but how much gold and silver they contain.

**In summary:**

 - Labor is the ultimate measure of exchangeable value (or real price). Money price is just an estimate.
 - Money price is decided by the gold and silver contained in it. A coin may increase or lose in value because of damage or adulteration. The money price that people agreed upon is the amount of pure gold and silver.
