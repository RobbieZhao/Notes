## On Writing Well—William Zinsser

####Introduction
 - The essence of writing is rewriting. Just because they're writing fluently doesn't mean they are writing well.

#### The transaction
 - Ultimately the product that any writer has to sell is not the subject being written about, but who he or she is.

#### Simplicity
 - But the secret of good writing is to strip every sentence to its cleanest components. Every word that serves no function, every long word that could be a short word, every adverb that carries the same meaning that's already in the verb, every passive construction that leaves the reader unsure of who is doing what—these are the thousand and one adulterants that weaken the strength of a sentence.
 - How can the rest of us achieve such enviable freedom from clutter? The answer is to clear our heads of clutter. Clear thinking becomes clear writing; one can't exist without the other. It's impossible for a muddy thinker to write good English.

#### Style
 - Writers are obviously at their most natural when they write in the first person.
 - If you aren't allowed to use "I", at least think "I" while your write, or write the first draft in the first person and then take the "I"s out.
 - Sell yourself, and your subject will exert its own appeal. Believe in your own identity and your own opinions. Writing is an act of ego, and you might as well admit it. Use its energy to keep yourself going.

#### The audience
 - Your are writing for yourself.
 - First, work hard to master the tools. Simplify, prune and strive for order. Then, express who you are. Relax and say what you want to say.

#### Words
 - Writing is learned by imitation .If anyone asked me how I learned to write, I'd say I learned by reading the men and women who were doing the kind of writing I wanted to do and trying to figure out how they did it. But cultivate the best models. Don't assume that because an article is in a newspaper or a magazine it must be good.
 - Also bear in mind, when you're choosing words and stringing them together, how they sound. This may seem absurd: readers read with their eyes. But in fact they hear what they are reading far more than you realize. Therefore such matters as rhythm and alliteration are vital to every sentence.

#### Unity
 - You learn to write by writing. It's a truism, but what makes it a truism is that it's true. The only way to learn to write is to force yourself to produce a certain number of words in a regular basis.
 - Choose from among the many variables and stick to your choice.
   - One choice is unity of pronoun.
   - Unity of tense is another choice.
   - Another choice is unity of mood.
 - Think small. Decide what corner of your subject you're going to bite off, and be content to cover it well and stop.
 - As for what point you want to make, every successful piece of nonfiction should leave the reader with one provocative thought that he or she didn't have before. Not two thoughts, or five—just one.
