## On Writing Well—William Zinsser

####Introduction
 - The essence of writing is rewriting. Just because they're writing fluently doesn't mean they are writing well.

#### The transaction
 - Ultimately the product that any writer has to sell is not the subject being written about, but who he or she is.

#### Simplicity
 - But the secret of good writing is to strip every sentence to its cleanest components. Every word that serves no function, every long word that could be a short word, every adverb that carries the same meaning that's already in the verb, every passive construction that leaves the reader unsure of who is doing what—these are the thousand and one adulterants that weaken the strength of a sentence.
 - How can the rest of us achieve such enviable freedom from clutter? The answer is to clear our heads of clutter. Clear thinking becomes clear writing; one can't exist without the other. It's impossible for a muddy thinker to write good English.
