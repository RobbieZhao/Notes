Compilation of C programs:

 - Preprocessing
   - removing comments
   - expanding macros
   - expanding included files
 - Compiling: generates assembly language
 - Assembly: convert assembly code into binary code
 - Linking
   - static linking
   - dynamic linking

Scope vs extent:

 - scope: where in the program this variable is available for use
 - extent: how long it exists
