## Word order

 - An adverb is a word that modifies a verb, an aadjective or another adverb, and is typically positioned before that word
 - Subject-object-verb (SOV) is a common word-order pattern in Latin.
 - A noun in the genitive case usually follows the noun it modifies.
 - An adjective was usually positiioned next to its noun (except in poetry, where word order is much freer). Most often the adjective followed the noun; common exceptions were adjectives denoting size or number, as well as demonstratives (**hic**, *this*; **ille**, *that*), which normally precede, as do adjectives which the speaker or writer wishes to emphasize.
 - Typical word order in a simple Latin sentence or clause is:
   1. the subject and its modifiers
   2. indirect object and modifiers
   3. direct object and modifiers
   4. adverbial words or phrases
   5. verb
