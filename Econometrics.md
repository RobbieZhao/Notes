## Chapter 1


#### Data

 - Experimental data
 - Nonexperimental data (aka, observational data or retrospective data)

#### How do perform empirical economic analysis
 1. **Construct a economic model**: consists of mathematical equations that describe various relationships
 2. **Turn the economic model into a econometric model**
   - The betas describe the directions and strengths of the relationshiop between the two variables.
   - Dealing with the error term or disturbance term is perhaps the most important component of any econometrics analysis.

#### Data Structure
 - **Cross-Sectional Data**: A sample of individuals, households, firms, cities, states, countries, or a variety of other units, taken at a given point in time.
   - Often assume it is obtained by random sampling
   - Be careful when random sampling might be violated by, say, dependent draws
 - **Time Series Data**: Observations on a variable or several variables over time.
   - More difficult to analyze than cross-sectional data: 
     - Economic observations can rarely be assumed to be independent across time.
     - Trending: highly persistent nature of many economic time series
 - **Pooled Cross Section**: Have both cross-sectional and time series features.
   - Increases sample size
   - See how a key relationship has changed over time
 - **Panel or Longitudinal Data**: A times series for each cross-sectional member in the dataset.
   - Same cross-sectional units are followed over a given time period, can also be treated as a pooled cross section, where members happen to show up in each point in time
   - Multiple observations on the same units allows us to control for certain unobserved characteristics of members
   - Allow us to study the importance of lags in behavior or the result of decision making

#### Other
 - **ceteris paribus**: other (relevant) factors being equal
