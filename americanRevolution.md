# Lecture 3 Being a British American

What made life different from being a British subject in England?

- The distinctive character of the people who migrated to the colony
  - rish-takers
- The distinctive living conditions in British America
  - more people owned land
  - broader franchise: more voting and political participation
  - the nature of the colonial social structure
    - difference in the proportions between the elite and laboring class than that of England, more of a middling society
    - not much difference between the top and the bottom of the social spectrum
    - several generations of people have never been to England and had no personal tie to England
  - ethnic and religious diversity
  - living on a frontier fostered a sense of independency and community (partly in a defensive way)
  - better health conditions: food was plentiful
- The nature of the British administration of the colonies: light-handed
  - people have developed their own legislature to be self-governing

- New ideas, new values, were emerging in the English-speaking world, but the past was tenacious. British culture still dominate the colonies.
- England and the colonies were in many ways alike. 
  - Unruly, defiant of authority (Reason: Being in a monarchical world means being subjects of the king, which is thought to be the common tie between people. This has implications of humiliation and dependency)
  - Liberty and independence (relevant, not absolute)
  - Rich in religiosity
  - Crude and barbarous
  - egalitarianism
- Royal authorities in the colonies are more deep-rooted and more effective by mid-century than ever before.
  - Part of the reason is that they don't know what a king is like. 
  - Religion bolstered monarchical authority
  - The social hierachy is inclusive. Everyone has their rank by what they do or who they are. The distribution of wealth is far more equal than the nineteenth century
